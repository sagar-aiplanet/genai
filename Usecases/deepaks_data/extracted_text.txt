Total bilirubin is invariably increased in jaundice. Causes of jaundice are prehepatic, resulting from various hemolytic
diseases; hepatic, resulting from hepatocellular injury or obstruction; and posthepatic, resulting from obstruction of the
hepatic or common bile ducts.

Aspartate aminotransferase is present in high activity in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Increased serum AST activity
commonly follows myocardial infarction, pulmonary emboli, skeletal muscle trauma, alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis,
and drug-induced hepatitis.

Alanine aminotransferase is present in high activity in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney. Serum ALT increases
rapidly in liver cell necrosis, hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver tumours, obstructive jaundice, Reye’s syndrome,
extensive trauma to skeletal muscle, myositis, myocarditis, and myocardial infarction.

Alkaline phosphatase is elevated in fever and increased bone metabolism, for example, in adolescents and during the
healing of a fracture; primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism; Paget’s disease of bone; carcinoma metastatic to
bone; osteogenic sarcoma; and Hodgkin’s disease if bones are invaded. Hepatobiliary diseases involving cholestasis,
inflammation, or cirrhosis increased ALP activity; also increased in renal infarction and failure and in the complications
of pregnancy. Low ALP activity may occasionally be seen in hypothyroidism.

Serum GGT is a sensitive indicator of hepatobiliary disease and is useful in the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice and
chronic alcoholic liver disease, in the follow-up of chronic alcoholics undergoing treatment, and in the detection of
hepatotoxicity. GGT is more responsive to biliary obstruction than AST, ALT, or ALP.

Total serum protein levels can be used for evaluation of nutritional status. Causes of high total serum protein
concentration include dehydration, Waldenstr6m’s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, hyperglobulinemia,
granulomatous diseases, and some tropical diseases. Causes of low total serum protein concentration include
pregnancy, excessive intravenous fluid administration, cirrhosis or other liver diseases, chronic alcoholism, heart
failure, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, neoplasia, protein-losing enteropathies, malabsorption, and severe

malnutrition.

HbA1C is used to monitor fluctuations in blood glucose concentration in the past 8 to 12 week’s period.
The reference interval defined as per American Diabetes Association guidelines 2016:

a) Less than 5.7% : Non Diabetic

b) 5.7 to 6.4% : at increased risk of developing diabetes in the future
c) More than 6.5% : Diabetic

d) Therapeutic glycemic target:

i. Adults: less than 7%

ii. | Children with Type 1 diabetes : less than 7 %

e) Pregnant diabetic patients : less than 6.5%

Note:

* Targets may be individualized based on: Age/life expectancy, Comorbid conditions, Diabetes duration , Hypoglycemia status,
Individual patient considerations

Reference: American Diabetes Association. Standards of medical care in diabetes—2021.

Mean Blood Glucose is average Blood glucose which directly correlates with A1C, reported in the same units as blood sugar levels
(mg/dl). Thus it reflects the average glucose concentration in the past 8 to 12 weeks period. This should not be compared with
Fasting or Post prandial or random blood sugar which measures glucose concentration at that point of time of testing.

Electrolytes are used to find and monitor conditions that affect the balance of fluids, electrolytes and acidity in the
body and also helps nerves and muscles work properly.
High urea and BUN levels is suggestive of poor kidney function due to acute or chronic kidney diseases, decreased
blood flow to the kidneys as in congestive heart failure, shock, stress, recent heart attack or severe burns; bleeding

from the gastrointestinal tract; conditions that cause obstruction of urine flow; or dehydration.Low urea levels are not

common and are not usually a cause for concern. They can be seen in severe liver disease or malnutrition but are not
used to diagnose or monitor these conditions. Low urea levels are also seen in normal pregnancy.

Creatinine is elevated in Kidney disease, damage, infection, urinary tract obstruction, reduced blood flow to the
kidneys in case of shock, congestive heart failure, complication of diabetes.
High levels of uric acid are seen in kidney disease,pre-eclampsia, purine rich food, alcoholism, and side effects of

cancer treatment.

Low levels of calcium may be due to hypoparathyroidism, kidney failure, pancreatitis, malnutrition, disorder in calcium
absorption. High levels of calcium may be due to hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, sarcoidosis, drugs like
diuretics, and excessive calcium supplementation.
Causes of high serum phosphorus include dehydration, hypoparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, metastases to
bone, sarcoidosis, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus with ketosis. Low serum phosphorus is
found in primary hyperparathyroidism and other causes of serum calcium elevation, sepsis, vitamin D deficiency, renal
tubular disorders, chronic hemodialysis, vomiting, and occasionally with decreased dietary phosphate intake.

Lipid profile is a group test consisting of various lipids. Lipid profiles are generally collected with overnight fasting. However, Recent guidelines have
recommended non fasting samples for lipid profile for assessment of cardiovascular risk. The details for the study can be checked at_
https://amanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2733560

In certain instances measurements in the same patient can show physiological and analytical variations. In such cases three serial samples at an interval of 1
week each are recommended for Total cholesterol, TG, HDL and LDL.

Cholesterol levels are increased in primary hypercholesterolemia; secondary hyperlipoproteinemia, including nephrotic syndrome; primary biliary cirrhosis;
hypothyroidism; and in some cases, diabetes mellitus. Low cholesterol levels may be found in malnutrition, malabsorption, advanced malignancy, and

hyperthyroidism.

Triglyceride levels are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid
metabolism, or various endocrine disorders.

High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels is used to evaluate the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The risk of CHD increases with

lower HDL cholesterol concentrations.

LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol level, sometimes called “bad” cholesterol, makes up most of our body’s cholesterol. High levels of LDL cholesterol
raise your risk for heart disease and stroke.

Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol is produced in the liver and released into the bloodstream to supply body tissues with triglycerides. High

levels of VLDL cholesterol have

been associated with the development of plaque deposits on artery walls, which narrow the passage and restrict blood flow.

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), also called Thyrotropin is a hormone secreted into the blood by the Pituitary gland (a gland present in the brain)). It
signals the thyroid gland to make and release the thyroid hormones (T3 & T4) into the blood.
High TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not making enough thyroid hormone (primary hypothyroidism).
Low TSH level usually indicates that the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).
Factors influencing TSH levels:
Fasting: TSH level shows a significant decline after meal intake in comparison to fasting values. This may have clinical implications in the diagnosis and
management of hypothyroidism, especially Subclinical hypothyroidism.1
Circadian Rhythm: TSH levels follow a circadian variation, reaching peak levels between Morning 2 — 4 am and at a minimum between Evening 6-10 pm.
The variation is of the order of 50%. hence time of sample collection during a day can significantly influence on the measured serum TSH concentrations.2
Other Factors: Genetics, Poisonous substances and radiation exposure, Inflammation of the thyroid gland, Deficiency or excess of iodine in the diet,
Pregnancy, Certain medications — antidepressants, cholesterol lowering drugs, chemotherapy drugs, steroids, Thyroid cancer.

Increased protein in urine is seen in dehydration, kidney disorders, heart failure and transplant rejection. 24 hour urine protein and
Protein/creatinine ratio in a random urine sample recommended if increased.

Glucosuria can be seen in kidney disorders, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hormonal disorders, and pregnancy. To be correlated
with plasma glucose levels.

Ketonuria is seen in physical exercise, starvation, severe vomiting, exposure to cold, uncontrolled diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis)
Increased bilirubin levels should be followed up with Liver function tests and indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Increased urobilinogen can be seen due to haemolysis, megaloblastic anaemia and haemorrhage in tissues. Urobilinogen is
absent or reduced in obstructive liver disease and antibiotic therapy.

RBCs in urine (Haematuria) can be seen in anticoagulant therapy, bleeding diathesis and traumatic catheterization history to be
looked into. Dysmorphic RBCs suggestive of glomerular pathology. Non glomerular diseases line calculus, infections, tumours,
after strenuous exercise and diseases of the prostate.

Increase in pus cells are elevated in cases of UTI, to be correlated with urine culture, if clinically indicated. Infection can be in
either the upper or lower urinary tract or with acute glomerulonephritis, tubule interstitial nephritis. Leucocyte esterase detects
esterase enzyme released from the granules of leucocytes.

Infected urine may contain considerable amounts of nitrite as a result of bacterial nitrate reductase activity, and detection of nitrite
in urine is routinely used in the diagnosis of bacterial cystitis. It is indicative of the requirement of Urine culture and sensitivity
testing for identification and treatment of UTI.

Hyaline casts are seen normally (not associated with disease states); seen after strenuous exercise and with non renal diseases,
such as dehydration.

Granular casts can be seen in acute glomerulonephritis and pyelonephritis.
